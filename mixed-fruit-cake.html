            <li>1 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup orange juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups mixed dried fruits (raisins, currants, sultanas, chopped dried apricots)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped nuts (walnuts, almonds, cashews)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup candied ginger (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dark rum or fruit juice (optional, for soaking)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup glacé cherries (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease and line a 9-inch round cake pan or a loaf pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves), and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy using a hand mixer or stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, alternating with the orange juice and milk. Mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Fold in the dried fruits, chopped nuts, glacé cherries, candied ginger, lemon zest, and orange zest. Stir gently until evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>If using dark rum or fruit juice, soak the dried fruits in it for about 30 minutes before adding them to the batter for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Once completely cooled, the fruit cake can be served as is, or optionally brushed with a little more rum or fruit juice for added moisture and flavor.</li>
            <li>Store the cake in an airtight container for up to a week, or refrigerate for longer shelf life.</li>    
        </ol>
