        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box of strawberry cake mix</li>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup of crushed Oreos (about 8-10 cookies)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup of powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Oreo crumbs for decoration</li>
            <li>Fresh strawberries for decoration</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the strawberry cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs. Mix according to the instructions on the cake mix box until smooth.</li>
            <li>Fold in the crushed Oreos into the cake batter, mixing gently until combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans.</li>
            <li>Bake the cakes for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove from the pans and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>While the cakes are cooling, make the frosting by beating together the heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Once the cakes are completely cooled, spread a layer of frosting on top of the first cake layer.</li>
            <li>Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the entire cake.</li>
            <li>Decorate the cake with Oreo crumbs and fresh strawberries on top.</li>
            <li>Chill the cake in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the frosting to set.</li>    
        </ol>
